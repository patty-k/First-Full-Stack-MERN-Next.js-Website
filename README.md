# First-Full-Stack-MERN-Next.js-Website
With the help of JavaScript Mastery on youtube, I created my first MERN based website with substitution of Next.js for Node and Express. 
## Demo of the Application (Timestamp: 0:34 - 2:17)

## Summary
When Threads by Instagram first released, it became the fastest growing app ever with 800 million signups in 5 days, surpassing chatgpt and tiktok in the process. After getting familiar with first JavaScript and then React, Next.js was my next stop for app development. Next.js is the best way to use React in 2023 as it's even the first recommended framework in react docs. In fact, their docs don't even recommend creating plain react apps anymore. For the api routing, next js provides an easier way to do so which allows you to avoid express server! 

Through this 5 hour and 40 minute tutorial video, I created a detailed 19 page note and developed the application. I learned:
- Master Next.js 13.4 with Server Side Rendering
- Learn MongoDB handling of complex schemas, multiple data population
- Create beautiful layouts with TailwindCSS
- Use Clerk for authentication
- Handle file uploads with UploadThing
- Explore Shadcn components
- Listen to real-time events with webhooks
- Understand middleware, API actions, and authorization
- Explore & integrate new Next.js layout route groups
- Validate data with Zod
- Manage forms with react hook form
- Create reusable components
- Build a solid application architecture
- Deploy the application and more!
